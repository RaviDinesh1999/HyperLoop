# Project summary:
    In this Hyperloop project, we can build a network of stations connected to one another. The commands listed below are used to set up a network and assign passengers to their pods.

        - By using the INIT command, we can establish a starting station and connections between all stations.
        - By using the ADD_PASSENGER command, we may add people to the queue along with information about their destination and age.
        - By using the START_POD command, we may assign n pods to n passengers based on their age it will prioritize them and  the Djikstra algorithm will choose the shortest path to get them there.
        - Using the PRINT_Q command, we can output the list of passengers still present at the beginning station.
        - Using the EXIT command, we can end the function.
